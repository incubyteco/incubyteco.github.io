Learning is the most vital part of a software developer's life. Being so busy that one stops learning is neither desirable nor helpful to one's career. Sandro wrote in his book Software Craftsman, having one year of experience ten times does not mean having ten years of experience.

Apart from learning programming languages like Java or Python, we should also aim to become proficient at our Source Control Management software, build systems, leadership skills, communication, documentation, cloud infrastructure technologies, excel, and word too!

Expanding your horizon helps you find the most befitting solutions to various problems of coding and the underlying business.
