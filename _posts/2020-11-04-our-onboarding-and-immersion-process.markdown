Onboarding is the process of introducing a newly hired employee to the organisation. It is everything that leads up to the employee’s total immersion into the organisation’s culture. Effective onboarding helps the employee relate better with organisation and get up and running quickly.

Immersion is the process of creating a common future and common purpose for all employees by aligning expectation, values, purpose, mission and goals.

At Incubyte, the onboarding and immersion process covers three broad areas:

1. Operational
2. Technical
3. Cultural

These together, help provide a holistic understanding about the company and the employees' role within the company.

Next we've tried to show what a typical onboarding process looks like.

### Offer Acceptance to Day 0

Onboarding starts with a call with our People Success Team to go through terms of the offer, details around compensation and benefits, and best practices, expectations and etiquette for remote working.

A workplace Buddy from the same team is assigned to each new employee for a smooth transition into their new role. The Buddy helps understand workplace systems, processes and culture, resulting in a shorter settling in period. They also walk through our recommended reading list, video list and any relevant trainings that the new employee might be required to complete prior to joining. Post joining, this is their go to person for any questions, in the initial nerve-wrecking weeks on the new job.

We do an AMA (Ask Me Anything) call with their Buddy for the new employee to ask any lingering questions ahead of the start date. This is a no holds barred time to talk about anything and everything, or just plain simple socialize with their to-be co-workers.

We also like to get all our paperwork wrapped up and a laptop delivered prior to joining, so that come Day One, they're ready to jump right in!

### Day One and Two

As a way of introducing the new employee to everyone in the company, we invite them to attend all team stand-ups on Day One.

They talk to their Buddy about what a typical day looks like, including getting introduced to the team's agile boards, iteration life cycle, pairing practices, lightning talks, IDE usage, among others!

They'll do calls with the People Success Team to understand company policies in detail and talk to the founders to learn more about our company culture and expectations we have of them.

### Day Three to Five

In the first week, we encourage the new employee to do one-on-one calls with each person in their team to get to know them, their role in the team and just in general, say hello. They then dive into learning the ropes of the product they're working on.

### Week Two and Three

This is when the new employee starts dipping their feet into actual work and starts seeing their name on the agile board. Domain knowledge sharing continues at each and every stage as they start pairing and participating in day-to-day activities.

At the end of second week, they fill out a form for the People Success Team to ensure that onboarding has gone well and check-in on how they're doing. This also helps us continuously improve and evolve our Onboarding process.

### Week Four

By now, the (not so) new employee has a more structured understanding of their role and responsibilities, how we work, company policies and culture as well as communication expectations.

Towards the end of week four, we do one-on-ones with the founders and the People Success Team to discuss how things have gone, any mutual concerns and areas of improvement.

### And that's the end of onboarding

Our hope is that this process helps establish clear expectations, immerse new hires into the company culture, while equipping them with the right tools, context and connections to get them started.

Employees are our biggest assets and we're committed to doing whatever we can to ensure they have the smoothest possible start to an exciting journey together.
